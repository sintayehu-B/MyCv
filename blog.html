                Written Argument about Relative-sizing
            </p>
            <article>
                <p>Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) one styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ? Why ? [write your argument] <br> Hint : consider the browsers capability of providing zoom feature?</p>
                <p>I admit that I like that simplicity, but I'm starting to think it's a little too dreamy for all but the simplest of sites. The main issue: you just can't expect type that you set at one screen size to look just right by simply scaling it down entirely proportionally. Big type might get too big scaling up. Small type might get too small (a common one that gets me). Or even the reverse of either, where big type might not get small enough. 
                    If any of those things happen, then you're making @media query specific adjustments which not only gets confusing but isn't very efficient (adjusting size just to adjust it again to fix it). 
                    So here's my idea: you still keep px size adjustments at the document level so you can make easy/efficient sweeping size changes. But then each module on the page has a font-size set in rem. Actual text elements (h1, h2, p, li, whatever), if you size them at all, are sized in em, and thus become relative to the module.
                    This way you can adjust font-size at a module level, which is pretty easy. The chances the type within a single module have good proportions and can scale together nicely is high. <br> We end here our encounter with CSS rem units. It is obvious that there are many advantages in using these units in our code, like responsiveness, scalability, improved reading experience, and greater flexibility in defining components. Rem units not a universal silver bullet solution but, with careful deployment, they can solve many problems that have irked developers for years.

            <p class="title">How Does the browser relate to the new font-sizing set to it.</p>
            <p>We said 16px is default browser width so what does it mean when we say 200px ? How does the browser interpret that ?</p>
            <p>In IE 6 and below, font-size set in pixels cannot be resized by the user.
                If we haven’t set font-size ant where on the page, then it would be the browser default which is 16 px. So by default 1em = 16px. If we were to go and set a font-size of 200px on our body, then 1em = 200px.
                With that being said the browser will interpret that as a new default for the browser and if no font-size is set to the particular, then the browser will assign the default value of 16px to that particular attribute. 
                .

            <p class="title">Specific Changes in CSS3</p>
            <p>Explain in detail(in technical terms) the specific changes in css3?</p>
            <p>CSS3 version supports many more browsers than CSS2 but be sure to test it on all operating system and browser. And CSS3 is advanced than CSS.New features added in CSS3 <br>
            1. New Pseudo-element <br>
            2. Transition <br>
            3. Claculating value with calc() <br>
            4. Box sizing <br>
            5. Generated content & counters <br>
            6. Border images <br>
            7. Media quires <br>
            8. 3d transformations <br>
            9. Text shadow <br>
            10. Sun filter
            </p>
            <h5>New Pseudo-element </h5>
            <p>New Pseudo-element: A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
                For example, it can be used to: <br>
                •	Style the first letter, or line, of an element <br>
                •	Insert content before, or after, the content of an element 
            </p>
            <h5>Transition </h5>
            <p>Perhaps the most exciting addition to CSS3 is the ability to apply animations to elements, without the use of JavaScript</p>
            <h5>Claculating value with calc() </h5>
            <p>calc() is a native CSS way to do simple math right in CSS as a replacement for any length value (or pretty much any number value). It has four simple math operators: add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/). Being able to do math in code is nice and a welcome addition to a language that is fairly number heavy. The calc() CSS function lets you perform calculations when specifying CSS property values. It can be used anywhere a length, frequency, angle, time, percentage, number, or integer is allowed.</p>
            <h5>Box sizing</h5>
            <p>The box-sizing property can make building CSS layouts easier and a lot more intuitive, The box-sizing property in CSS controls how the box model is handled for the element it applies to. This is often called "universal box-sizing", and it's a good way to work! The (literal) width you set is the width you get, without having to perform mental math and manage the complexity that comes from widths that come from multiple properties. We even have a box-sizing awareness day around here.</p>
            <h5>Generated content & counters</h5>
            <p>Generated content was first introduced in the CSS2 specification. For several years, the feature was used by relatively few Web authors due to inconsistent browser support. In technical terms, generated content is a simple abstraction created by CSS in the document tree. As such, in practical terms, generated content exists only in the layout of the Web document.</p>
            <h5>Border images</h5>
            <p>The new CSS3 property border-image is a little tricky, but it can allow you to create flexible boxes with custom borders (or drop shadows, if that's your thing) with a single div and a single image. In this article, I explain how the border-image shorthand property works in today's browsers. <br>
                1.  An image to use as the border <br>
                2.	Where to slice that image, dividing the image into 9 sections <br>
                3.	How the browser should apply those sections to the edges of your element
            </p>
            <h5> Media quires</h5>
            <p>Media quires let the content adapt to screen resolution, such as altering the size of pictures and text based on the screen size. It became a web standard in 2012.</p>
            <h5>3d transformations</h5>
            <p>With the introduction of CSS transforms, elements could be shifted, rotated, slanted, squashed and stretched. Web designers were finally able to catch up to print designers. With CSS 3D transforms, web designers can move past their print counterparts and explore a new realm in graphic design.</p>
            <h5>Text shadow</h5>
            <p>text-shadow is one of the few CSS properties that we can omit the use of vendor-prefixes. Quite similar to box-shadow, it must be applied to text, and receives the same four parameters:</p>
            <h5>Multiple Backgroungs</h5>
            <p>The background property has been overhauled to allow for multiple backgrounds in CSS3.
                Let's create a silly example, simply as a proof of concept. For lack of any suitable images nearby, I'll use two tutorial images as our backgrounds. Of course, in a real-world application, you might use a texture and, perhaps, a gradient for your backgrounds.
